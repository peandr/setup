# Setup-Repo
These are some scripts I use to install minimal servers of different distros,
like Arch, Debian, Ubuntu and maybe later on freeBSD. I use so called
post-config scripts to configure the machine. In other words, it's a short
and of course time saving way to replicate a server. The  abbreviation like
"al" stands for "ArchLinux", "du" for "Debian and Ubuntu", "fbsd" for "freeBSD".
